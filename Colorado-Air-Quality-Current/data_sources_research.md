# Reliable Data Sources Research

## Air Quality Data Sources

### 1. EPA AirNow API (Primary Source)
- **URL**: https://docs.airnowapi.org/
- **Description**: Real-time air quality observations from over 2,000 monitoring stations
- **Coverage**: United States, Canada, and Mexico
- **Data Types**: PM2.5, Ozone, AQI values and categories
- **Authentication**: Requires API key (free registration)

#### Available Endpoints:
1. **Current Observations by Zip Code**
   - Get current AQI values and categories for a reporting area by Zip code
   
2. **Historical Observations by Zip Code**
   - Get historical AQI values and categories for a reporting area by Zip code
   
3. **Observations by Monitoring Site**
   - Get AQI values or data concentrations for specified date/time range within geographic area
   
4. **Forecasts by Zip Code**
   - Get current or historical forecasted AQI values and categories

### 2. EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API
- **URL**: https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html
- **Description**: Primary place to obtain row-level data from EPA's Air Quality System database
- **Data Types**: Comprehensive air quality monitoring data
- **Use Case**: Official regulatory air quality data

## Health Data Sources

### 1. CDC Environmental Health Tracking Network
- **URL**: https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/DataExplorer/
- **Description**: Asthma emergency department visits and hospitalization data
- **Data Types**: 
  - Emergency department visits for asthma
  - Age-adjusted rates per 10,000 population
  - County-level data

### 2. Colorado Environmental Public Health Tracking
- **URL**: https://coepht.colorado.gov/asthma-data
- **Description**: Colorado-specific asthma data
- **Data Types**:
  - Annual age-adjusted asthma emergency department rates
  - Monthly data available for download
  - County-level statistics

### 3. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE)
- **API URL**: https://data-cdphe.opendata.arcgis.com/
- **Available Datasets**:
  - Asthma Hospitalization Rate by Counties
  - Asthma Prevalence in Adults
  - Age-adjusted rates of asthma-related hospital discharges

## Data Correlation Research

### Scientific Evidence for Air Pollution-Health Correlation:
1. **Short-term exposure effects**: 10-15% increase in emergency department visits following PM2.5 increases
2. **Lag time**: Health effects typically appear 1-3 days after pollution exposure
3. **Seasonal patterns**: Summer months show highest correlation (July-August peak)
4. **Pollutant-specific effects**:
   - PM2.5: Strongest correlation with respiratory issues
   - Ozone: Significant impact during hot weather
   - NO2: Strong correlation with ER visits

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Air Quality Data
1. Register for AirNow API key
2. Implement endpoints for Colorado zip codes
3. Set up data caching to avoid rate limits
4. Store historical data for trend analysis

### Phase 2: Health Data Integration
1. Access CDC tracking data via API
2. Implement Colorado CDPHE data feeds
3. Calculate correlation coefficients
4. Apply appropriate lag times (1-3 days)

### Phase 3: Data Validation
1. Cross-reference multiple sources
2. Implement data quality checks
3. Add uncertainty indicators
4. Provide source attribution

## Reliability Measures
- Use only government-verified data sources
- Implement multiple data source validation
- Add disclaimers about data limitations
- Provide links to original data sources
- Regular data freshness checks
